## Description

Deployed Website URL: **[Book Search Deployed App](https://book-search-viewer-2f4ed48c79f2.herokuapp.com/)**

Welcome to the Book Search Engine! This application is a awesome example of the power of web development. It's a full-stack web app that allows readers to search for new books to read, create a list of books to purchase, and manage their reading interests easily.

The app is built using the MERN stack, which includes React for the front end, MongoDB for the database, and Node.js/Express.js for the server and API. In addition, it uses Apollo Server to provide a GraphQL API, which allows for efficient data retrieval and modification. You can search for books, save them to your account, and organize your reading collection effortlessly.
